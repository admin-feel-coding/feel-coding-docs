# New Engineer Checklist

Use this list to get aligned in your first week. This repository is documentation-only, so your first deliverable is understanding the delivery model and how we communicate.

## Day 1: Orientation
- Read `docs/00-company/company-bible.md` and note any principles that surprise you.
- Read `docs/01-frameworks/d2e-framework.md` and map each phase to your past experience.
- Skim `docs/02-delivery/delivery-pricing-bible.md` to understand how we price and gate work.

## Day 2: Delivery model
- Read `docs/02-delivery/project-lifecycle.md` and summarize each stage in your own words.
- Review the diagrams in `docs/03-diagrams/README.md` and open the D2E diagrams.
- Review `docs/05-glossary/glossary.md` and add any missing terms you notice.

## Day 3: Contribution habits
- Write a short decision record using `docs/04-templates/decision-record-template.md`.
- Draft a Discovery Summary using `docs/04-templates/discovery-summary-template.md`.
- Draft a Phase Plan using `docs/04-templates/sdlc-phase-plan-template.md`.

## By end of week
- Be able to explain D1–D6, E1–E6, and O1–O4 without notes.
- Be able to describe why Discovery is paid and independent.
- Be able to describe how phase-based pricing protects both sides.

If any document is unclear, update it. Clarity is part of the job.
