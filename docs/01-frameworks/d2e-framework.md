# D2E Framework

D2E stands for **Decide, Execute, Operate**. It is the delivery framework Feel Coding uses to structure every client engagement.

The framework separates decisions from execution. Each phase is independent, documented, and produces concrete outputs that the client owns. A client can stop after any phase and still keep everything they need to continue on their own.

## Overview
```
DECIDE → EXECUTE → OPERATE
```

| Phase | Primary question | Output focus |
|---|---|---|
| **Decide** | What are we building and why? | Clarity, scope, and risk reduction |
| **Execute** | How do we build it and ship it? | Working software and delivery documentation |
| **Operate** | How do we keep it healthy and evolving? | Stability, improvement, and transferability |

See the visual overview: [D2E Big Picture](../03-diagrams/d2e-big-picture.mmd).

## Decide (Discovery)
Discovery is a **paid, standalone phase** focused on clarity and risk reduction. SDLC does not start until Discovery is approved.

**Steps (D1–D6):**
- **D1 Problem & Outcomes**
- **D2 Requirements**
- **D3 Solution Shaping**
- **D4 MVP & Phases**
- **D5 Estimation**
- **D6 Proposal-Ready Plan**

**Outputs:**
- Written Discovery Summary
- Architecture sketch
- Phased roadmap
- Hour estimates per phase

See: [Discovery Flow](../03-diagrams/decide-flow.mmd).

## Execute (SDLC)
Execution is the SDLC loop that builds what Discovery already decided.

**Loop (E1–E6):**
- **E1 Plan**
- **E2 Design**
- **E3 Build**
- **E4 Test**
- **E5 Deploy**
- **E6 Review**

**Outputs:**
- Working software
- Technical documentation
- Tests and deployment guidance

See: [SDLC Loop](../03-diagrams/sdlc-loop.mmd).

## Operate
Operate keeps the system healthy after delivery and can be hourly or retainer-based.

**Steps (O1–O4):**
- **O1 Monitor**
- **O2 Fix**
- **O3 Improve**
- **O4 Optimize**

**Outputs:**
- Runbooks and operational documentation
- Monitoring signals and incident learnings
- Ongoing improvements and cost optimizations

See: [Operate Loop](../03-diagrams/operate-loop.mmd).

## Key properties
- **Independent phases.** Each phase stands on its own. There is no lock-in.
- **Documented outputs.** Every phase produces documentation that belongs to the client.
- **Transferable.** The client can bring in a different team at any point.
- **Scalable.** Works for solo engagements and larger teams.
