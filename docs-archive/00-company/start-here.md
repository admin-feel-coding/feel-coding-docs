# Start Here

This repository is the internal knowledge base for Feel Coding. It is documentation-only. New engineers should use this reading order to get oriented quickly.

## Recommended reading order

1. **Company Bible** — how we work, what we value, and what must stay true in every engagement.
   - `docs/00-company/company-bible.md`
2. **D2E Framework** — the delivery model that separates decisions from execution.
   - `docs/01-frameworks/d2e-framework.md`
3. **Delivery & Pricing Bible** — how Discovery, SDLC, and Operations are packaged and priced.
   - `docs/02-delivery/delivery-pricing-bible.md`
4. **Engagement Models** — the four ways Feel Coding works with clients and partners.
   - `docs/00-company/engagment-models.md`
5. **Project Lifecycle** — how engagements move from first contact to close.
   - `docs/02-delivery/project-lifecycle.md`
6. **New Engineer Checklist** — practical steps for first-week alignment.
   - `docs/00-company/new-engineer-checklist.md`
7. **Glossary** — definitions of recurring terms.
   - `docs/05-glossary/glossary.md`

## How to contribute

- Use plain language. If a new engineer cannot understand a page quickly, rewrite it.
- Document decisions. If it is not written down, it did not happen.
- Use Mermaid for diagrams (`.mmd`) and link to them from Markdown with relative paths.
- Keep templates in `docs/04-templates/` generic and reusable.

If something conflicts with the Company Bible, the Company Bible wins.
