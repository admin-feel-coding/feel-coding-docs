**Bible Section · Version 1.0**

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **engagement models** under which Feel Coding operates.

It exists to:

* Allow Feel Coding to work with **different kinds of clients**
* Preserve a **single delivery framework (D2E)**
* Maintain **clarity, boundaries, and sustainability**
* Avoid improvisation or emotional decisions
* Enable Feel Coding to scale without changing its identity

This document answers the question:

> **“In what ways does Feel Coding work with people and companies?”**

---

## 2. Core Rule (Applies to All Models)

> **Feel Coding uses one framework (D2E), but multiple engagement models.**

* The **framework never changes**
* The **relationship model changes**
* Scope, pricing, and depth adapt — principles do not

---

## 3. Engagement Model Overview

Feel Coding operates under the following official engagement models:

1. **Client Delivery (Standard)**
2. **Individual / Idea-Driven Engagement**
3. **Startup / Founder Partnership**
4. **Productized / Exploratory Work**

Each model:

* Has a clear purpose
* Has explicit boundaries
* Applies D2E differently
* Can be accepted or declined deliberately

---

## 4. Model A — Client Delivery (Standard)

### Definition

A traditional **client–service provider** relationship with an established company.

### Typical Clients

* SMEs
* Corporates
* Funded startups with structure
* International clients (LATAM, North America, Europe)

### Relationship Type

* Client ↔ Service provider
* Professional, contractual

### Payment Model

* **Discovery (D)**: Paid, fixed or time-boxed
* **Execution (E)**: Hourly or milestone-based
* **Operations (O)**: Optional, hourly or retainer

### How D2E Applies

* **D**: Full Discovery (D1–D6)
* **E**: Full SDLC execution
* **O**: Optional post-delivery

### Rules

* Discovery is **never free**
* Phases are **independent**
* Documentation is mandatory
* Scope changes follow change-control rules

### When This Model Is Preferred

* Clear business objectives exist (or can be discovered)
* Budget exists
* The client values professionalism and predictability

### Doctrine

> This is the **default** and most stable engagement model.

## 5. Model B — Individual / Idea-Driven Engagement

### Definition

Engagement with **individuals or informal teams** who have ideas but no formal company or structure.

### Typical Clients

* Solo founders
* Non-technical individuals
* Freelancers with an idea
* Early concept creators

### Relationship Type

* Advisor / builder / technical guide
* High uncertainty, low structure

### Payment Model

* **Discovery (D)**: Mini Discovery (D1–D3), paid
* **Execution (E)**: Small, time-boxed, hourly
* **Operations (O)**: Usually none

### How D2E Applies

* **D**: Reduced depth, focus on clarity and feasibility
* **E**: Small, carefully scoped execution
* **O**: Rare or unnecessary

### Rules

* Scope is aggressively reduced
* Overbuilding is avoided
* No long-term commitments
* Clear limits are enforced

### When This Model Is Used

* Idea is early and unclear
* Budget is limited
* Value is in guidance more than building

### Doctrine

> Feel Coding helps **clarify**, not **carry** unstructured ideas.

This model protects both the client and Feel Coding.

## 6. Model C — Startup / Founder Partnership

### Definition

A **selective partnership** with early-stage founders or startups where Feel Coding may act as:

* Technical partner
* Advisor
* Early technical lead

### Typical Clients

* Pre-seed startups
* Solo founders with strong vision
* Early teams without technical leadership

### Relationship Type

* Partner / advisor / collaborator
* High trust, high risk

### Payment Model

* Mixed:
  * Partial cash
  * Deferred payment
  * Equity or upside (optional, not default)

### How D2E Applies

* **D**: Lightweight or partially unpaid (case-by-case)
* **E**: Selective milestones only
* **O**: Usually postponed

### Rules (Very Important)

* This model is **optional and selective**
* Feel Coding is not obligated to accept partnership work
* Equity or free work is never automatic
* Clear exit conditions must exist

### Selection Criteria

Feel Coding considers this model only if:

* Strategic alignment exists
* Trust exists
* Long-term value outweighs short-term cost
* Risk is consciously accepted

### Doctrine

> Partnership is a **choice**, not a favor.

* **E**: Internal execution
* **O**: Optional

### Rules

* Must have a clear purpose
* Must not drain core delivery capacity
* Must align with long-term positioning

### Doctrine

> Productized work exists to **create leverage**, not distraction.

## 8. Cross-Model Principles (Non-Negotiable)

These principles apply to **all engagement models**.

### Principle — Phase Independence

Every phase must:

* Deliver standalone value
* Be documented
* Allow the client to stop or continue freely

---

### Principle — Transparency Over Lock-In

Feel Coding never:

* Hides knowledge
* Creates artificial dependency
* Withholds documentation

---

### Principle — Sustainability First

Feel Coding protects:

* Time
* Energy
* Focus

No engagement model is allowed to compromise sustainability.

---

### Principle — Best Option, Not Only Option

> Feel Coding aims to remain the **best choice**, not the **only choice**.

---

## 9. Decision Authority

Feel Coding reserves the right to:

* Choose the engagement model
* Decline projects that don’t fit any model
* Transition between models if circumstances change

This authority is exercised deliberately and without apology.
