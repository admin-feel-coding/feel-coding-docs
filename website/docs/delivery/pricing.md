# Pricing

This page explains how Feel Coding prices work. It is written for both clients and internal teams.

For delivery phases and the D2E structure, see [D2E Framework](../framework/d2e.md).

---

## 1. Purpose

Pricing should do three things:

- Set expectations clearly.
- Protect delivery quality.
- Reduce risk for both sides.

---

## 2. Pricing principles

- Discovery is always paid.
- Work is scoped in phases and approved before start.
- Estimates are ranges, not promises.
- Each phase has a clear checkpoint.
- Transparency beats precision.

---

## 3. Pricing models map to D2E

We price by phase. Each model matches a D2E stage so clients always know what they are buying.

## 4. Pricing models (by D2E)

### 4.1 Decide (Discovery) — fixed fee or time-boxed

Use Discovery to turn uncertainty into a concrete plan. It is a standalone engagement that ends with written outputs.

Includes:

- D1-D6 documented.
- Architecture sketch.
- Phased roadmap.
- Estimate ranges with known risks.

### 4.2 Execute (SDLC) — phase-based hourly ranges (default)

Each phase has its own scope and estimate range. The client approves each phase before it starts.

Rules:

- Every phase has a defined goal.
- We agree on a range before work starts.
- Changes prompt a quick re-alignment and updated estimate.

### 4.3 Execute (SDLC) — time-boxed sprint (optional)

Use when speed matters and scope can flex. You sell a fixed time window with a clear goal, not a fixed feature list.

Rules:

- Fixed duration and team size.
- A short, prioritized scope list.
- Clear exit criteria.

### 4.4 Operate — retainer

Use for post-delivery support and improvement. The retainer buys availability and predictable response times.

Rules:

- Define what is included and what is not.
- Set a response window.
- Track hours and report monthly.

---

## 5. Estimation and quoting

Every estimate includes:

- A best and worst case range.
- A list of known risks.
- A list of unknowns that could change the scope.

If the unknowns are too large, stop and sell Discovery first.

---

## 6. What every proposal includes

- Scope summary.
- Deliverables by phase.
- Estimated range per phase.
- Assumptions and exclusions.
- Change control rule.
- Payment schedule.

---

## 7. Change control

When scope changes:

1. Document the change.
2. Re-estimate together.
3. Update the phase plan and timeline.

---

## 8. One rule to remember

If we cannot clearly explain what we are building, we do not build it.
