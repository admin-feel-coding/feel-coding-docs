# Project Lifecycle

This document describes how a typical project moves from first contact to completion at Feel Coding.

## Stages

### 1. Discovery (Decide)

Paid, independent discovery to define the problem, MVP, risks, and estimates. This stage produces a written Discovery Summary and a proposal-ready plan.

### 2. Execution (SDLC)

Build the agreed solution using the SDLC loop (Plan, Design, Build, Test, Deploy, Review). Work is phase-based with estimated hour ranges and review checkpoints.

### 3. Operate

Post-delivery support to monitor, fix, improve, and optimize the system. This may be hourly or retainer-based.

### 4. Review and handover

At the end of each phase or the full engagement, conduct a structured review. Ensure documentation is complete and the client can continue independently.

### 5. Close

Formally close the engagement. Archive project materials and capture lessons learned.

## Principles during delivery

- Progress is visible at all times.
- Blockers are raised within 24 hours.
- Documentation is updated continuously, not at the end.
- The client can request a status summary at any point.
