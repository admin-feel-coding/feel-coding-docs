# Delivery & Pricing Bible

**Version 1.0**

---

## 1. Purpose of this document

This document defines **how Feel Coding works**.

It exists to:

- Ensure consistency across all projects
- Protect delivery quality
- Protect time and energy
- Set clear expectations with clients
- Allow Feel Coding to scale from solo to small team without chaos

This document is internal, but parts of it may be shared with clients when useful.

---

## 2. Core principle

> Feel Coding separates decisions from execution.

We do not jump into building software without first deciding:

- What problem we are solving
- What the smallest valuable solution is
- What risks exist
- What "done" means

This is how we protect clients, ourselves, and long-term reputation.

---

## 3. D2E Framework reference

Delivery follows the D2E Framework. For full detail on Discovery, SDLC, and Operate (including D1-D6 and E1-E6), see [D2E Framework](../framework/d2e.md).

## 4. Pricing doctrine

### 4.1 General rules

- Discovery is **always paid**.
- Execution is **hourly or time-boxed**.
- No phase depends financially on the next.
- Estimates are ranges, not promises.
- Transparency beats precision.

### 4.2 Phase-based pricing model

Each phase:

- Has a defined scope
- Has an estimated hour range
- Is approved before starting
- Can be stopped after completion

This applies to:

- Small clients
- LATAM clients
- North American clients
- Internal or external projects

---

## 5. Client relationship principles

Feel Coding:

- Does not oversell
- Does not hide risk
- Does not promise certainty where none exists
- Prefers long-term trust over short-term revenue

If a project is unclear or risky:

- We propose Discovery
- Or we say no

Both are professional outcomes.

---

## 6. Solo-first, scale-ready

This framework is designed to:

- Work when Feel Coding is a solo operation
- Scale naturally when collaborators are added
- Allow delegation by phase, not chaos

Anyone joining Feel Coding must:

- Understand this framework
- Follow it
- Respect its boundaries

---

## 7. One rule to remember

> If we cannot clearly explain what we are building, we do not build it.

---

## 8. Canonical summary

```
FEEL CODING OPERATING MODEL:
- Decide before Execute
- Discovery is paid and independent
- Work is phased, estimated, and optional
- SDLC executes agreed decisions
- Trust > speed > volume
```
