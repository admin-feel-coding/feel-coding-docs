# New Engineer Checklist
A simple week-one guide for new team members.

Use this list to get aligned in your first week. Your first deliverable is understanding the delivery model and how we communicate.

## 📅 Day 1: Orientation

- Read the [Company Bible](company-bible.md) and note any principles that surprise you.
- Read the [D2E Delivery Framework](../framework/d2e.md) and map each phase to your past experience.
- Skim the [Pricing](../delivery/pricing.md) page to understand how we price and gate work.

## 📅 Day 2: Delivery model

- Read the [D2E Delivery Framework](../framework/d2e.md) and summarize each phase in your own words.
- Review the [Glossary](../reference/glossary.md) and add any missing terms you notice.

## 📅 Day 3: Contribution habits

- Draft a Discovery Summary using the [Decide Template](../templates/decide-template.md).
- Draft a Phase Plan using the [Execute Template](../templates/execute-template.md).
- Review the [Operate Template](../templates/operate-template.md).

## ✅ By end of week

- Be able to explain D1-D6, E1-E6, and O1-O4 without notes.
- Be able to describe why Discovery is paid and independent.
- Be able to describe how phase-based pricing protects both sides.

If any document is unclear, update it. Clarity is part of the job.
