# 🧭 Engagement Models

**Version 1.0**

---

## 1. 🎯 Purpose of this document

This document defines the **engagement models** under which Feel Coding operates.

It exists to:

- Support different client types without changing the framework
- Maintain clarity, boundaries, and sustainability
- Avoid improvisation or emotional decisions

This document answers the question:

> "In what ways does Feel Coding work with people and companies?"

---

## 2. 🧱 Core rule (applies to all models)

> Feel Coding uses one framework (D2E), but multiple engagement models.

- The framework never changes
- The relationship model changes
- Scope, pricing, and depth adapt — principles do not

---

## 3. 🗂️ Engagement model overview

Feel Coding operates under four official engagement models:

| Model | Name | Typical client |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | Client Delivery (Standard) | SMEs, corporates, funded startups |
| **B** | Individual / Idea-Driven | Solo founders, non-technical individuals |
| **C** | Startup / Founder Partnership | Pre-seed startups, early teams |
| **D** | Productized / Exploratory | Internal or public-facing tools |

Each model has a clear purpose, explicit boundaries, applies D2E differently, and can be accepted or declined deliberately.

---

## 4. Model A — Client Delivery (Standard)

Traditional **client-service provider** relationship with an established company.

**Typical clients:** SMEs, corporates, funded startups with structure, international clients (LATAM, North America, Europe).

**Payment model:**

- Discovery (D): Paid, fixed or time-boxed
- Execution (E): Hourly or milestone-based
- Operations (O): Optional, hourly or retainer

**How D2E applies:**

- D: Full Discovery (D1-D6)
- E: Full SDLC execution
- O: Optional post-delivery

**Rules:**

- Discovery is never free
- Phases are independent
- Documentation is mandatory
- Scope changes follow change-control rules

This is the **default** and most stable engagement model.

## 5. Model B — Individual / Idea-Driven Engagement

Engagement with **individuals or informal teams** who have ideas but no formal company or structure.

**Typical clients:** Solo founders, non-technical individuals, freelancers with an idea, early concept creators.

**Payment model:**

- Discovery (D): Mini Discovery (D1-D3), paid
- Execution (E): Small, time-boxed, hourly
- Operations (O): Usually none

**How D2E applies:**

- D: Reduced depth, focus on clarity and feasibility
- E: Small, carefully scoped execution
- O: Rare or unnecessary

**Rules:**

- Scope is aggressively reduced
- Overbuilding is avoided
- No long-term commitments
- Clear limits are enforced

:::info Doctrine
Feel Coding helps **clarify**, not **carry** unstructured ideas.

## 6. Model C — Startup / Founder Partnership

A **selective partnership** with early-stage founders or startups where Feel Coding may act as technical partner, advisor, or early technical lead.

**Typical clients:** Pre-seed startups, solo founders with strong vision, early teams without technical leadership.

**Payment model:**

- Mixed: partial cash, deferred payment, equity or upside (optional, not default)

**How D2E applies:**

- D: Lightweight or partially unpaid (case-by-case)
- E: Selective milestones only
- O: Usually postponed

**Rules:**

- This model is optional and selective
- Feel Coding is not obligated to accept partnership work
- Equity or free work is never automatic
- Clear exit conditions must exist

**Selection criteria:** Strategic alignment exists, trust exists, long-term value outweighs short-term cost, risk is consciously accepted.

:::info Doctrine
Partnership is a **choice**, not a favor.
:::

---

## 7. Model D — Productized / Exploratory Work

Internal or public-facing work created by Feel Coding for learning, signaling expertise, market exploration, or future leverage.

**Typical examples:** Free tools, generators, templates, demos, internal experiments, open-source or semi-open tools.

**Payment model:** Free, low-cost, or indirect (marketing, credibility, learning).

**How D2E applies:**

- D: Internal decisions
- E: Internal execution
- O: Optional

**Rules:**

- Must have a clear purpose
- Must not drain core delivery capacity
- Must align with long-term positioning

:::info Doctrine
Productized work exists to **create leverage**, not distraction.
:::

## 8. ✅ Cross-model principles (non-negotiable)

These principles apply to **all** engagement models.

**Phase independence** — Every phase must deliver standalone value, be documented, and allow the client to stop or continue freely.

**Transparency over lock-in** — Feel Coding never hides knowledge, creates artificial dependency, or withholds documentation.

**Sustainability first** — No engagement model is allowed to compromise time, energy, or focus.

**Best option, not only option** — Feel Coding aims to remain the best choice, not the only choice.

---

## 9. 🔒 Decision authority

Feel Coding reserves the right to:

- Choose the engagement model
- Decline projects that don't fit any model
- Transition between models if circumstances change

This authority is exercised deliberately and without apology.
