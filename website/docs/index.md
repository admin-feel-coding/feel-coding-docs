# Feel Coding Wiki

Welcome to the Feel Coding documentation hub.

This wiki contains everything you need to understand how Feel Coding operates — from delivery frameworks to engineering principles and handoff standards.

## How to use this wiki

- **Framework** — how we structure and deliver work (D2E: Decide, Execute, Operate)
- **Delivery** — standards, checklists, and processes for running projects

Use the sidebar to navigate between sections, or use the search bar to find specific topics.

## Where to start

If you are new to Feel Coding, start with the [D2E Framework](framework/d2e.md) to understand how we approach every engagement.

## Contributing

All documentation lives as Markdown files in this repository. To suggest a change, open a pull request against `main`. Every page has an "Edit this page" link at the bottom.
