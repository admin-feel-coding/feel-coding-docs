# Core Principles

These principles guide every decision at Feel Coding. They apply to how we build, how we communicate, and how we work with clients.

1. **Clarity over cleverness.** Write things down. Use plain language. Make it understandable.
2. **Ownership is non-negotiable.** Every task, decision, and deliverable has a clear owner.
3. **Documentation is a deliverable.** If it is not documented, it is not done.
4. **Trust through transparency.** Share progress openly. Raise problems early.
5. **Simplicity by default.** Choose the simplest approach that solves the problem.
6. **Independence over dependency.** Leave clients able to continue without us.
7. **Feedback is a gift.** Give it directly and respectfully. Receive it with openness.

For the full explanation of these principles in practice, see the [Company Bible](company-bible.md).
