# Handoff Checklist
A simple checklist to make handoff clear and complete.

How Feel Coding handles the transition of work back to the client or to another team.

## ✅ Principles

- The client must be able to continue without us from the moment we leave.
- All knowledge must be written down, not carried in people's heads.
- Handover is a process, not a single event.

## 📋 Checklist

- [ ] All source code is in the client's repository under their control
- [ ] Technical documentation is complete and up to date
- [ ] Architecture decisions are recorded with context and reasoning
- [ ] Deployment and operational procedures are documented
- [ ] Access credentials and environment configurations are transferred
- [ ] Open issues and known limitations are documented
- [ ] A walkthrough session has been conducted with the receiving team
- [ ] The client confirms they have everything they need

## 🧱 Exit criteria

An engagement is considered complete when:

1. All agreed deliverables have been produced and accepted.
2. The handover checklist is fully satisfied.
3. The client confirms readiness to continue independently.
4. A retrospective has been conducted and documented.
