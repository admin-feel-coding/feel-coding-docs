# Company Bible
A clear, public summary of how Feel Coding thinks and works.

This document is the single source of truth for how Feel Coding operates. It defines the principles, expectations, and standards that guide everything we do — internally and with clients.

If something contradicts this document, this document wins.

## ✅ Core principles

### Clarity over cleverness

We write things down. We explain decisions. We avoid jargon when plain language works. If someone new joins a project and cannot understand it within a reasonable amount of time, we have failed at documentation — not them.

### Ownership is non-negotiable

Every task, document, decision, and deliverable has a clear owner. Ownership means you are responsible for the outcome, not just the activity. If something is unclear, the owner is responsible for making it clear.

### Documentation is a deliverable

Documentation is not an afterthought. It is part of the work. A feature without documentation is not complete. A decision without a written record did not happen.

### Trust through transparency

We build trust by being visible. Clients see our work as it happens. Teams share progress openly. Problems are raised early, not hidden. We do not surprise people.

### Simplicity by default

We choose the simplest approach that solves the problem. We do not add complexity for the sake of sophistication. Every layer of abstraction must earn its place.

### Independence over dependency

We leave clients able to continue without us. We build capability, not reliance.

### Feedback is a gift

We give feedback directly and respectfully. We receive it with openness.

## 🧭 How we work

- We communicate in writing as the primary medium. Meetings support written decisions, not replace them.
- We use structured frameworks to deliver projects. These are documented and shared with clients from day one.
- We leave every engagement in a state where the client can continue without us.
- We version and maintain our documentation the same way we version code.

## 🤝 How we treat clients

- Clients own everything we produce for them.
- We explain what we are doing and why, in terms they understand.
- We do not create dependency. We create capability.
- We are honest about what we know and what we do not know.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 How we treat each other

- We give direct, respectful feedback.
- We assume good intent.
- We ask for help early.
- We share what we learn.
