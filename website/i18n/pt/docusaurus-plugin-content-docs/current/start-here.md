# Start Here

New to Feel Coding? Use this reading order to get oriented quickly.

## Recommended reading order

1. [Company Bible](company/company-bible.md) — how we work, what we value, and what must stay true in every engagement.
2. [D2E Framework](framework/d2e.md) — the delivery model that separates decisions from execution.
3. [Pricing](delivery/pricing.md) — how work is packaged and priced.
4. [Engagement Models](company/engagement-models.md) — the four ways Feel Coding works with clients and partners.
5. [Project Lifecycle](delivery/lifecycle.md) — how engagements move from first contact to close.
6. [New Engineer Checklist](company/new-engineer-checklist.md) — practical steps for first-week alignment.
7. [Glossary](reference/glossary.md) — definitions of recurring terms.

## How to contribute

- Use plain language. If a new engineer cannot understand a page quickly, rewrite it.
- Document decisions. If it is not written down, it did not happen.
- Keep templates generic and reusable.
- Every page has an "Edit this page" link at the bottom.

If something conflicts with the Company Bible, the Company Bible wins.
